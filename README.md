# Word Frequency - OO

## Directions

In this project, you will implement the [word frequency project](https://github.com/momentum-assignments/py--word-frequency) previously assigned using classes and objects. Take a minute to go to that project and refresh your memory as to how it works.

## Starter Files

A starting program is located in `word_frequency.py`. This program contains 3 classes that you will need to implement in order to make the program work. Every method you will need in these classes is defined already. You will have to remove the line in each method that raises a `NotImplementedError` and write the body of the method.

You may create another class for the word frequencies (referenced in `WordList.get_freqs`), use a dictionary, or another data structure of your choice.
